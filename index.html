<a id="background" class="anchor" href="#background" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background:</h2>

<p>Alzheimer's disease is one of the most important mental illnesses. It is posited that more than 25% of the population is affected by mental disease during their lifetime. Each patient draws resources from the economy concerned. Therefore, it is important to quantify the potential economic threat.</p>

<h2>
<a id="methods" class="anchor" href="#methods" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Methods:</h2>

<p>Agent-based, system dynamics and numerical approaches to dynamic modeling of the population of the European Union and its patients with  Alzheimerâ€™s disease are presented in this article. Simulations, their characteristics, and the results from different modeling tools are compared. An agent-based model is created in Rust and C#, a system dynamics model is created in the Stella modeling tool, and a numerical model has been implemented in Java.</p>

<h2>
<a id="results" class="anchor" href="#results" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Results:</h2>

<p>The results of these approaches are compared with EU population growth predictions from the statistical office of the EU by Eurostat. The methodology of the creation of the models is described and the modeling approaches are compared. The suitability of each modeling approach for the population modeling is discussed.  </p>

<h2>
<a id="conclusions" class="anchor" href="#conclusions" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conclusions:</h2>

<p>In this case study, all three approaches met our expectations and gave us the results corresponding with the EU population prediction. Moreover, we were able to predict the number of patients with AD and, based on the modeling method, we were also able to monitor different characteristics of the population. </p>
